# 3D House Drawing with Pycairo
This project uses Python and the Pycairo library to render a 2D representation of a house with a simulated 3D effect. The image includes details such as the main house structure, a slanted red roof, chimney, windows, and door, aiming to resemble the style shown in a reference image.

# Features
House Base: A light gray rectangular structure representing the main body of the house.
Roof: A red roof with depth, created by adding light red side panels to enhance the 3D effect.
Chimney: Two-tiered chimney on the roof.
Door: A brown door with a handle.
# Requirements
Python 3.x
Pycairo library
# To install Pycairo, run:

pip install pycairo
Clone or download this repository.

Navigate to the project directory where the 3D_house.py script is located.

Run the script to generate the house image.

Example Output
The generated image should resemble the reference image provided in the project, with a red slanted roof, chimney, and basic 3D-like features.

Troubleshooting
TypeError in Transformations: Ensure that youâ€™re not directly passing multiple arguments to context.transform(). Check the function syntax to avoid transformation issues.
Pycairo Installation Issues: If Pycairo is difficult to install, make sure to have development tools on your system, as Pycairo may need them.
